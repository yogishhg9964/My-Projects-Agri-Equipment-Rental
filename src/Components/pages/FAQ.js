            <Accordion.Header>Why farm equipment rental?</Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Equipment rental helps companies reduce their fixed costs and minimises the financial
              risks of owning equipment fleets. By renting rather than owning, the user only pays for
              equipment when it is needed, and rental reduces the ongoing costs that come with equipment ownership,
              including maintenance, in-service inspections, repairs, transportation and storage. Rental
              allows companies to cope with peak workloads without having to invest in extra equipment.
              It represents a low-risk way of obtaining equipment when market conditions are uncertain
              and allows companies to enter new markets or sectors without burdensome investments in machinery
              capital that would otherwise be tied up in equipment can be channelled into a company's core business.

              <p>
                Rental equipment is typically classified as an operating expense, as it is necessary for the day-to-day
                operations of the business. This is the most common expense category for rental equipment, and is typically
                the most straightforward to classify.</p>

              <li type="none"><b>Capital Expenditures:</b></li>
              <p>In some cases, rental equipment may be classified as a capital expenditure. This is typically the case when the
                equipment is considered to be a long-term asset of the business, and is not expected to be replaced or upgraded
                on a regular basis. Capitalizing rental equipment can have tax implications, so it is important to consult with
                a tax advisor before making this classification.</p>

            <Accordion.Header>Why buy when you can rent equipment?</Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Whereas the main benefit of Renting is flexibility, the main benefit of Purchasing is control.
              If you own the equipment,
              then you have control over both the access to the asset and control over its specifications.
              Owning a piece of equipment will allow your staff to become experts in its operation, and also enables
              your repair personnel to understand the equipment’s technical requirements, individual quirks, and past repair history.

            <Accordion.Header>Is equipment rent a current asset?</Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Body>
              Equipment is not considered a current asset. Instead, it is classified as a long-term asset. The reason for this classification
              is that equipment is designated as part of the fixed assets category in the balance sheet, and this category is a long-term asset;
              that is, the usage period for a fixed asset extends for more than one year. This classification of equipment extends to all types of equipment, including office equipment and production machinery.
